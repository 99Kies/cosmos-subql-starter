  # This endpoint must be a public non-pruned archive node
  # We recommend providing more than one endpoint for improved reliability, performance, and uptime
  # Public nodes may be rate limited, which can affect indexing speed
  # When developing your project we suggest getting a private API key
  endpoint: ["https://rpc-comdex.zenchainlabs.io/"]
  # Optionally provide the HTTP endpoint of a full chain dictionary to speed up processing
